def manipulate_file():
    # Create and open the file in write mode
    with open("sample.txt", "w") as file:
        # Append three lines to the file
        file.write("Line 1\n")
        file.write("Line 2\n")
        file.write("Line 3\n")
    
    # Open the file in read mode
    with open("sample.txt", "r") as file:
        # Read and print the first line
        first_line = file.readline()
        print("First line:", first_line)
    
    # Delete the file
    import os
    os.remove("sample.txt")
